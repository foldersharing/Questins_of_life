Q 1 -: Who is more successful 
Based on a true story there was a  iitian i think in 2012, he was first ranker in jee advanced and therefore he was in iit bombay , after that he won the internation physics olymiad and got first rank there also and then he went for mathematics olympiad and there also he won the first rank internationally, then he dropped the iit and went to mit for a reseach in "high energy particle".
Now on the other hand there was Sundar Pichai Rajan got it iit kharagpur, into metallurgy branch(not by choice other wise the scenario would have been something else)  and finally became the ceo of google and had gained the extraordinary fame and money.
Now the question arises the first guy never tasted any failure, lived the life in god mode, but today unknown, with less money relatively, and the second man failed once in his life to achieve the desired branch( although the branch he got was not something to be taken lightly but still) .
I am confused whom should i declare the winner of this competition.
I want  to know what this all concludes, who among them is a failure, or is it that this discussion is absolutely pointless to compare to really successfull people.
Is  this discussion pointing toward the failure residing in me, not knowing what real success is and just comparing, not knowing that there could be no parameter to rate the success.
